# library
This webpage displays a simple library.  
Makes use of Javascript objects and object constructors.  
It contains a button, which brings up a form, to add a book to the library.  
The form makes use of pseudo-elements to indicate required, valid, and invalid input fields.  
CSS Flexbox is used to center the library.  
Within the library, CSS Grid is used to place the books in 'cards'.  
Each book has a button to remove it from the library.  
Additionally, each book contains a button to toggle its read status.
